    "# Gemini Batch API Test Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the Gemini Batch API for processing large volumes of rug analysis requests asynchronously at 50% reduced cost. The Batch API is ideal for non-urgent, large-scale tasks with a target turnaround time of 24 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features Covered:\n",
    "- File-based batch processing with JSONL uploads\n",
    "- Inline batch requests for smaller datasets  \n",
    "- Job status monitoring and result retrieval\n",
    "- Error handling and job management\n",
    "- Integration with our Next.js rug processing application"

    "## Summary and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated the complete Gemini Batch API workflow for processing rug analysis requests at scale with 50% cost savings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Benefits of Batch API:\n",
    "- **Cost Effective**: 50% reduction in processing costs\n",
    "- **Scalable**: Handle large volumes (up to 2GB per file)\n",
    "- **Asynchronous**: Non-blocking processing with 24-hour SLA\n",
    "- **Reliable**: Built-in error handling and retry mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integration with Next.js App:\n",
    "The techniques demonstrated here are already integrated into our rug processing application:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **File Upload**: `src/app/api/submit-batch/route.ts`\n",
    "2. **Job Monitoring**: `src/app/api/batch-status/route.ts`  \n",
    "3. **Result Retrieval**: `src/app/api/download-results/route.ts`\n",
    "4. **Request Generation**: `src/lib/gemini-service.ts`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Considerations:\n",
    "- Monitor job quotas and limits\n",
    "- Implement proper error recovery\n",
    "- Set up job cleanup procedures\n",
    "- Use appropriate polling intervals\n",
    "- Handle timeout scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing Your Implementation:\n",
    "1. Upload a CSV file through the Next.js web interface\n",
    "2. Generate batch requests with your rug data\n",
    "3. Submit the batch job and monitor progress\n",
    "4. Download and analyze results when complete\n",
    "\n",
    "The Batch API is ideal for large-scale rug inventory processing, product description generation, and bulk AI analysis tasks."
